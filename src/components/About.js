          I am a senior at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a double major in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction. 
          I am an adaptable and caring leader that can quickly adjust to changing situations while keeping the needs of otherâ€™s in mind. 
          Last summer, I joined a research project at the last minute because my internship was shortened due to COVID-19. 
          The project was on studying cyber attacker behaviors, where I have created models representing different types of attackers and built a simulation to analyze how these different attackers collaborate. 
          When I first joined, the professor entrusted me to mentor a freshman researcher, while going through the onboarding process myself. 
          Through this process I learned how to balance doing my work while mentoring others, in addition to enhancing my backend development expertise.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Some of my hobbies include playing sports like Tennis and Basketball. I also like taking on challenges, such as the Tough Mudder race I ran in September of 2019.
